# CMDEditor

# Usage

Enter file path (hit enter to use current directory)

Enter the file name that you want to edit

It should look like this:



Hit enter

To insert a line, specify the line where you want to insert a value. You can do this by specifying a positive integer, then writing the value of the line (For example, if you want to insert "Hello, World!" to line 10, use "10 Hello, World!")




In case if you want to insert a line under a specified line, write "+", then the specified line as a positive integer and the line you want to insert. (For example, if you want to insert "Hello, World" under line 14, use "+ 14 Hello, World!")




If you want to list the file that you're currently editing, hit enter without specifying anything.
